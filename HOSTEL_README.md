## Image Storage with Cloudinary

Hostel images are now uploaded and stored using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). The backend handles image uploads and stores the returned Cloudinary URLs in the database. **Firebase Storage is no longer used for images.**

### Cloudinary Features
- **High-Quality Images**: Images are displayed using Cloudinary's `q_auto:best` transformation for optimal quality.
- **Image Slider**: All hostel images are shown in a Swiper slider, supporting multiple images per hostel.
- **Fullscreen Modal/Lightbox**: Click any image to view it fullscreen in a modal for a better viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The slider and modal are fully responsive and accessible.
- **Custom Transformations**: You can customize Cloudinary transformations (e.g., resizing, cropping, quality) by editing the image URL or backend logic.

### Cloudinary Setup
1. **Create a Cloudinary account** at https://cloudinary.com/ (free tier is sufficient).
2. **Get your credentials** from the Cloudinary dashboard:
   - Cloud name
   - API Key
   - API Secret
3. **Add these to your `.env.local` file:**
   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
4. **Install the Cloudinary SDK:**
   ```bash
   npm install cloudinary
   ```
5. **No further setup is needed.** The backend API will handle all uploads and return the Cloudinary image URLs for use in the app.

## UI Improvements
- **Single Card Per Row**: Hostel cards are now displayed one per row for better readability.
- **Modern Card/Grid Design**: The UI uses a clean, modern design with responsive layouts.
- **Accessible Image Viewing**: All images are accessible and can be viewed fullscreen for better detail.
